     1. External Libraries
           code that is outside of our project
             we can use script tag to put this code in our code

            why we use External Libraries
             - let us share code
             - save time
             - avoid duplicating work 

             Dayjs to deal with dates

 Best Practice 
  When we need something complicated,
   - Try to find an external library first.
   - Before writing the code ourselves 

 How to find external  library
  - search google like <prgraming language > External library for< type or work of library>   
    Ex -> js library for adding date in our page
  - search in any of the ai tool

  Problem with loading js through script tag
   - because script tag will load the code in page without wrapping it we can have name conflicts 
   - but if we load it using js modules then this module will contain this external library inside a file so variable and functions inside a file will not conflict with anything outside of it           

  ESM Version
   ESM- EcmaScript Module 
   A version that works with js modules

   Default Export 
    - another way of exporting
    - we can use it when we only want to export 1 thing 
    - In a file only one default export is possible 
    - It increases the readability

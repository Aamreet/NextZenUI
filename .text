// in previous part we were updating the changes in the page at runtime using dom which is good but if we to update a lot of things using dom it will update it one by one 
    ex -> if you change the delivery option it will be updated in order-summary and also in payment-summary it will be updated one by one using dom and we have to reload the page to

// Now to update the page instead of using the dom we will rerun  all the code which will regernate all the html
  
    The above technique is called MVC (Model - View - Controller)
      1. Update the data
      2. Regenerate all the HTML

      MVC 
      split our code in 3 parts
       1. Model= All the code that saves and manages the data 
                Ex all the code in our data folder is Model
       
       2. View = takes the data and displays it on the page
                    ex all the files in scripts folder because the take the data and genrate html
       
       3. Controller = runs some code when we interact with the page
                        ex  eventlistners in our code because they do something when we interact with the page or view

           make note of this timestamp -> mvc working - 1:02:40 (How mvc work in loop)
        
           mvc is a design pattern as it is a way to organize and design our code
                 many modern web devlopment frameworks use mvc design pattern ex express genrator
